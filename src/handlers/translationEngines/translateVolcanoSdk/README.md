## Volcano translate sdk - 火山翻译sdk 

This is the code extracted from the `base` of [volc-sdk-nodejs](https://github.com/volcengine/volc-sdk-nodejs), the reason for the extraction is that when using the original sdk directly it encounters `Cannot set properties of undefined (setting 'xxh_update').` error and this error comes from the original sdk `src\services\tls\lz4.js`
